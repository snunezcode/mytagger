### IAM Role Deployment

If the tagging process needs to be performed across multiple AWS accounts (which is the most common scenario), you will need to deploy a cross-account IAM role to access those accounts. The recommended approach is to deploy this role as an AWS CloudFormation StackSet from your management account. This will allow the role to be accessible across all the accounts that are part of the MAP project.
1.	Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2.	Navigate to the AWS CloudFormation service.
3.	Click on StackSets on the left-side menu.
4.	Click on Create StackSet.
5.	In the "Choose template" screen, select Service-managed permissions.
4.	Specify Template Source
    o	Choose "Upload a template file" 
    o	Click "Choose file" and select your CloudFormation template (cloudformation.iam.role.yaml)    
    o	Click "Next"
9.	Enter a name for the StackSet in the "StackSet name" field.
10.	In the "RoleARN" field enter the role ARN that was created during the the first template deployment (found in the Outputs section).
11.	Click Next.
12.	Click Next.
13.	In the “Set deployment options” select Deploy new stacks.
14.	Under the “Deployment targets” section select the option that fits best for the deployment.
15.	Under "Specify regions," select only one region (e.g., US East - N. Virginia).
Note: Since this CloudFormation StackSet only deploys an IAM role, which is a global service, selecting multiple regions will cause deployment errors. The StackSet will attempt to deploy the same IAM role in each region, leading to failures.
16.	Under "Deployment options," set Failure tolerance to 1. Important: This setting is crucial because the StackSet will attempt to redeploy the existing role in the original account. If the tolerance is not set to 1, the entire deployment will fail.
17.	In the "Review" screen, verify that all the parameters are correct.
18.	Select the I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names checkbox.
19.	Click Submit.
